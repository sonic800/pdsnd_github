### Project Title
Bikeshare

### Description
In the past decade, bicycle sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity. Thanks to rise in information technologies, it is possible to record wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project bike-sharing system data will be explored. The project will calculate various stats for bikeshare usage in **New York**, **Chicago** and **Washington** based on interactive selections from the user. Stats can be calculated separately for selected months or days based on user selection.

Stats being calculated are:
 * Most common month, day of week and hour of day
 * Most common start and end station, and most common trip
 * Total and average travel time
 * User type, gender and earliest, most recent and most common year of birth

### Files used
Project includes three input CSV files that contain raw data from Motivate, and bikeshare.py file containing the code

### Credits
Project was completed by following the requirements and guidance given in Udacity Programming for data science with Python course. https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104
